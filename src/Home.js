                <p>If we eat any food, or drink any beverage, we must recite a blessing over them before and after. When it comes to fruit juice, it's always better to eat whole fruit because it contains fiber -- which helps you feel full longer. Try not to drink more than 1 cup (8 ounces) of  100% juice each day. You can tell by the product label if a juice is 100% fruit juice or not. Water has no calories and no sugar. Water is always a good choice, but other healthier options include milk; 100% juice; and other unsweetened beverages such as unsweetened tea or coffee, sparkling water and water infused with fruit or herbs.</p>

The cold drinks that are available on the market contain sweeteners and preservatives. Frequent consumption of these cold drinks is not good for our health.</p>
